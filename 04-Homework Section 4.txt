1. What does one need to do to use a module?
To use a module, you must import it first using the import statement. 

2. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.
A commonly used module is random

3. What is a benefit of using Exception handling?
Exception handling ensures that programs can handle unexpected errors gracefully without crashing. It also helps in debugging and maintaining code reliability.

4. what are the 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?
The four components are:

try: Code that may raise an exception.

except: Code to handle the exception.

else: Code to execute if no exceptions are raised.

finally: Code that always executes, regardless of exceptions.


5. NumPy arrays are like what Python data type?
NumPy arrays are similar to Python lists but with additional functionalities and better performance for numerical operations.

6. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.
One of the main benefits is that they allow for element-wise operations and are highly optimized for performance compared to regular Python lists.

7. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?
All elements in a NumPy array must have the same data type (dtype), which ensures consistent and efficient operations.

8. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.
Two uses are:
Mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication and linear algebra.
Statistical analysis such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

9. Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?
A common library used alongside NumPy is pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

10. What is the shape of NumPy arrays?
The shape refers to the dimensions of the array and is represented as a tuple.

11. What is a Tensor?
A Tensor is a multi-dimensional array, often used in machine learning and deep learning to represent data. In essence, itâ€™s an extension of NumPy arrays to higher dimensions.

12. Name a reason why it's better using  NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?
NumPy is faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists, making it ideal for large-scale numerical computations.

13. When creating an "empty" array, where do the elements come from?
an "empty" array are uninitialized and contain arbitrary data (garbage values) that already exist in the allocated memory space.
